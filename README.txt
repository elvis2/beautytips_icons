Beautytips Icons allows you to add an icon to a custom tip via beautytips manager UI and move the beautytip popup to the icon.

By default, Drupal core message icons (16px or 24px) are available when adding the tip icon. Custom icons (png, gif or jpg) are auto-detected when the files are placed in sites/your-space/files/beautytips-icons or sites/your-space/themes/your-theme]beautytips-icons.

A big thanks to marcvangend for the tooltipformatter project. I re-used some of his code for dealing with core message icons.
